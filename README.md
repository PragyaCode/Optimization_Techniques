Project Name- Enhancing Model Efficiency and Accuracy Through Hyperparameter Optimization

Summary: 
The goal of the project is to improve machine learning model performance by focusing on hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameters are important for model performance, and finding the best combination can greatly enhance prediction accuracy. The project will investigate basic methods like Grid Search and Random Search, along with advanced approaches like Hyperopt, Scikit Optimize, and Optuna. These techniques will automate hyperparameter tuning to maximize model performance effectively. 

Tools: 

Python: The main language for implementing machine learning and hyperparameter optimization. 

Scikit-learn: Used for building machine learning models and applying hyperparameter optimization methods such as Grid Search and Random Search. 

Hyperopt: Used for tuning hyperparameters based on Bayesian optimization, offering efficient parameter search for complex models. 

Scikit Optimize: Applied for sequential model-based optimization, enabling optimization of black-box functions with minimal computational cost. 

Optuna: Used for hyperparameter optimization with distributed computing and parallel execution support to boost efficiency for large-scale optimization tasks.
